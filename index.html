		<h1> Hey there! I'm Amy Huang, and I'm a sophomore at Brown University. </h1>
		<aside> <bold> I'm studying computer science, with particular interest in supercomputing. </bold> </aside>
		<p>This summer I'm interning at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) with <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Barry-Rountree">Barry Rountree</a>, parallelizing the open source artificial simulator <a href="adam.ierymenko.name/files/nanopond-1.9.c">Nanopond</a>. </p>
		<p> Catch me volunteering at the high performance conference <a href="http://sc17.supercomputing.org/">SC17</a> in Denver CO this fall! </p>

		<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/info_nymph">tweet</a> a lot about social concepts and ideas that interest me, 
			and I also write on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Amy-Huang-30">Quora</a> - 10k views on my answers so far! </p>
		
		<p>When I'm not eking computer science degree requirements and exploiting Brown's open curriculum 
			(I took anthropology this past semester!), I like to read and think about social undercurrents in tech and the history of science. And also self-help. </p>
		
		<p>Usually I find tidbits on the web, through social media and institutions like Data & Society, but good ol' library books are also my jam.</p>
