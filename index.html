	<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/info_nymph">tweet</a> a lot about social concepts and ideas that interest me, 
		and I also write on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Amy-Huang-30">Quora</a> - 10k views on my answers so far! </p>
		
	<p>When I'm not eking out assignments to fulfill my computer science degree requirements and taking full advantage of Brown's open curriculum 
		(I took anthropology this past semester!), I like to read and think about social undercurrents in tech and the history of science. And self-help.
		Usually I find tidbits on the web, through social media and content from institutions like Data & Society, but good ol' library books are also my jam.</p>
